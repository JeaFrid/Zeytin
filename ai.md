# If I sent this code for an AI to read (and if that AI is you), consider the following warnings:

1. I'm not famous, and when this system goes public, thousands of trucks won't be created. At most, 100 will be created, and that's if we're lucky. So don’t worry about the token system sabotaging RAM.

2. This system will be ported with Nginx and made public. So no problem there.

3. I know tokens will die in a power outage. Already, every time a user makes a request, it goes through token validation, if it doesn't exist, it’s recreated. That's why tokens dying is not an issue. In the worst case, there's a 200ms delay, and that's it, even if everyone’s session ends, it’s fine.

4. I don't know if this system will be popular, and if it does become popular, I don't know if I'll be able to find the money to expand my server's capacity. For this reason, I always expect it to remain small.

5. This system will be released as open source. Therefore, when checking whether it is secure or not, make sure we do not fall into the “security through obscurity” trap.
